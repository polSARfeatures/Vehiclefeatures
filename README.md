# Vehiclefeatures

This project will be updated soon with the skeleton of the code which was used to produce the results in the IEEE article "Polarimetric SAR features for vehicle detection in natural surroundings".

As the data for the article is not available, this code will need to be adapted to other datasets, particularly regarding data loading and mask creation.
